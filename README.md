Puddle
======

Puddle is a simple theme for [Dropplets](http://dropplets.com).

##Demo
You can see the homepage [here](http://puddle-demo.herokuapp.com/), but the posts pages will be broken because of how Heroku works. I'll try to find a place to host an actual demo.

##Installation
Just copy the `puddle` folder into your `templates` folder, then select it from the list of installed templates in your dropplets menu.

##Customization
To customize the home screen/category page image, upload `puddle.jpg` as if it were a post image.

##Screenshots
The top one is the home page, and the bottom one is a post page.

##About
Currently, this is all unfinished, so you might have to fiddle around to get it to work.
