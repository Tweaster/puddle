Puddle
======

Puddle is a simple theme for [Dropplets](http://dropplets.com).

##Demo
There is currently no demo, because I don't have hosting. Sorry! If you upload one, let me know.

##Installation
Just copy the `puddle` folder into your `templates` folder, then select it from the list of installed templates in your dropplets menu.

##Customization
To customize the home screen/category page image, upload `puddle.jpg` as if it were a post image.

##Screenshots
The top one is the home page, and the bottom one is a post page.
